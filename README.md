- In the home page the user can enter the city of his/her choice.
- On clicking the SUBMIT button, the application will display the weather for the next 6 days
- The application must be responsive and mobile friendly (this feature is still to be added )



### Tools Used 

- Created an account on [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/.), and generated a key
- Got the weather data using the native JS [`fetch()`](https://devdocs.io/dom/fetch_api/using_fetch)
